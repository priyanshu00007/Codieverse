## 🛠️ Setup & Running Locally

This project is **frontend-only**. No backend or web server is required.

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**

   * Double-click `index.html` (or any `.html` file).
   * All CSS and JS load automatically.

3. **Navigate**

   * Use the **navbar links** to move between pages.

---

## 🔑 Authentication Simulation

* **Signup**

  * Username and password stored in `localStorage` under `users`.

* **Login**

  * Credentials checked against stored data.
  * On success:

    * `isLoggedIn` flag set to `true`.
    * Username stored.
    * Navbar updates with **Profile** & **Logout**.

* **Logout**

  * Clears `isLoggedIn` and `username` from `localStorage`.
  * Navbar resets to **Login/Signup**.

⚠️ **Note**
This authentication system is **for demonstration only**.
It is **not secure** and should not be used in production.
For real-world applications, use a secure backend with proper authentication and database management.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* ✅ Replace simulated authentication with a real backend (Node.js, Express, or Django).
* ✅ Add database integration (MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL).
* ✅ Improve search with full-text search and pagination.
* ✅ Add role-based dashboards for students and instructors.
* ✅ Implement blog comments and likes system.
* ✅ Add PWA (Progressive Web App) support for offline usage.

⚡ Question:  
Do you want me to also **add badges (like built with HTML, Tailwind, JavaScript)** and **screenshots preview section** to make the README look more professional?
